# Favorite CPSC 120L Labs:

* Lab 6, part 2

    This was my most favorite lab because it involved programming one of my favorite games which is Black Jack. Learning how to implement the different card functions, scoring functions, and math for adding the points was challenging. However, once we figured out how to code the functions, it was a fun experience to learn through the challenges of getting the game to work.

* Lab 9, part 2

    This was my second favorite lab as it involves making a guessing number game. This was one of the labs that involved working with the fstream library which is responsible for inputting or outputting files. Learning to take user input and to put it in a text file and to program a game that takes that text file to store the secret number was very fun to learn and with the addition of creating a fun number guessing game. 

* Lab 10, part 1

    This was my third favorite lab as it involves working with 2D vectors. Working with 2D vectors was very challenging but felt really rewarding once we learned how to implement the process of the 2D vectors. In the end, it was very interesting to program a code that calculates the amount of counties in the state and also the population if an input of a county is given.
